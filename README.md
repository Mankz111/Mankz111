# Hi there, I'm Miguel Pereira
### ☁️ Cloud Computing Student | Tech Enthusiast

I am currently studying **Cloud Computing**. This repository is where I document my learning journey, personal projects, and experiments driven by curiosity.

### What I'm exploring:
* **Cloud & Infra:** Learning the ropes of Cloud Architecture.
* **Cybersecurity:** Playing CTFs on TryHackMe for fun & knowledge.
* **AI/ML:** Experimenting with Machine Learning models.
